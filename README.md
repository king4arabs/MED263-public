## Office Hours
* Caitlin: Tuesday 10-11am
* Jihoon: Tuesday 7-8 pm



## Homework
* You will get a homework every Thursday.
* The expected level of homework is that whoever attended and followed well on the Thursday hands-on course should be able to answer the homework questions in a few hours.
* Homework is due by the following Thursday right before class (2:29 pm Thursdays).
* Turn in the homework to GradeScope.
* Provide all codes with answers to the questions.



## Final Exam
* Create a hands-on session document to perform data analysis with your own data (public or private data) similar to MED 263 class
* Following this document, students (or others) should be able to conduct a data analysis in the context of bioinformatics
* Turn in the hands-on session document to Dr. Curtius (deadline  TBA)
* Present the hands-on session during the class Tuesday, March 8th 2022, and Thursday March 10th 2022 (TBA-minute presetation each)
